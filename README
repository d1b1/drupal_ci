This repo contains a growing numbers of Jenkins Bash Scripts for a number of drupal jobs.

Assumptions:
1. Drupal is running on the jenkins master or slave.
2. Drupal is available on to the user; jenkins or the one you define.

Aegir:
To make the two processes jenkins and Aegir work together, I have changed the name
of the user running jenkins. Edit the /etc/defaults/jenkins file to use Aegir. You will
need to change the owner of the files setup by Aegir. 

I wanted Aegir and Jenkins to manage the same files, so that Jenkins would be able to
write to the files in the Aegir folder. Aegir needs to own all the files in the /var/aegir/platforms
so that the Aegir cron process can manage files. If Aegir has issues, the first place to check
is file ownership. Hense the reason all Aegir docs tell you to work in the /var/aegir folder as the 
aegir user; using sudo su -s /bin/bash - aegir

First, stop jenkins. /etc/init/jenkins stop

Then change the owner of all files in the following:

1. chown -R aegir /var/run/jenkins
2. chown -R aegir /var/log/jenkins
3. chown -R aegir /usr/share/jenkins

Then, restart Jenkins. /etc/init.d/jenkins start. You can confirm that jenkins is running as the expected user 
with the following:

ps aux | grep jenkins 

If the war file process is not using aegir, then you missed something. Repeat.

Future:
Over time I will be adding other scripting options, python etc to make it easier to setup CI scripts. For now 
bash and drush get the job done for drupal work. The scripts will be broken out as new approaches are tried. I
would like to roll more of the configuration options into a plugin, but am not ready.

Scripts:
1. drupal_basic_sh - bash script that has hardcoded URL and platform paths.
2. drupal_full.sh - bash script that has parameterized URL and platform paths.
